<h2 class = "whatisOurGoal">What is Our Goal?</h2>
<p class="whatisOurGoal">
Wendel Berry stated that “The Earth is what we have in common”.
Every human on Earth is different, but we all must protect our planet.
This website was built to spread awareness, address problems, and give solutions that everyone can use.
This website informs people about the dangers of fossil fuel, global warming, and the ways you can help.
The effects of the negative and mindless actions have caused damage to the habitats of not just humans but animals too.
Our oceans are being turned into giant trash cans. Yes, the one that covers 70 percent of our planet.
Oceans are among the Earth’s most valuable natural resources.
Most people have already been informed of the suffering of our Earth, but actions speak louder than words.
We encourage all to take action against the harm being done to our planet.
To quote Jacques Cousteau, “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.”

<h2 class="fossil-fuels">Why Fossil Fuels?</h2>
<p class="fossil-fuels">
Saving Planet focuses on all aspects of damage being caused.
One of the biggest reasons that our Earth is suffering is due to fossil fuels.
Alexandra Paul wisely stated,"There is a reason it is called fossil fuel, it is an out dated method of getting power."
When we burn fossil fuels, we pollute both the air and ocean. Our beloved seas have absorbed as much as a quarter of all man-made carbon emissions.
This drastic action changes the pH of surface waters and leads to acidification.
The acid has the ability to destroy reefs, shellfish, corals and fish.
One solution is to reduce your carbon footprint.
There are many cheap and simple ways you can do this.
Some ideas for reducing your carbon footprint include:
1)Eat less meat to avoid greenhouse gases. Livestock farming produces more greenhouse gasses than all transportation combined.
This causes most ocean acidification. Some healthy veggie sources of nutrition and protein include beans and lentils.
Reducing meat intake saves water, energy, and reduces greenhouse gases.
2)Use less energy and water in your home. Use ENERGY STAR® qualified products for appliances, light bulbs, etc.
These don’t just conserve energy but also save money. It takes lots of energy to pump and heat water, so saving water reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
You can use eco-friendly products that break down easily. Try getting cheap fossil fuel substitutes like solar panels.
3)Reduce your plastic addiction. Instead of plastic water bottles, try reusable metal or glass bottles.
Rather than using straws when you eat out, politely refuse or bring your own reusable metal straw.
It might not seem like much but it makes a big difference. You also don’t need plastic bags for food, try using glass containers instead.
Using reusable bags at the store is also important.
