    <h2 class="help">How Can I Help?</h2>
<p> Many people wonder how to keep the Earth healthy but don't know how to help. Don't worry, Saving Earth is here to help you protect the planet we all call home.
</p>
<h3 class="bruh"> Reduce, Reuse, Recycle </h3>
<p>Much of the waste we throw away ends up in the oceans and harms the organisms living there. You may not think that this impacts you, but it surely does in way or another. The trash that we throw out can end up in the systems of fish and seafood that we eat and it can harm us too. One way to tackle this problem is to make less waste. Reducing waste means producing less of it. The lower the amount of waste you make, the less there is to reuse and recycle. One way to reduce is to use multi-purpose items. If the possibility arouses, buy multi-functional items. Another way to help is to think about if what you are using is something that you really need. Try not to make more waste than is absolutley necessary. It is very important to reuse or re-purpose items that have out-worn their intended use to restrict the amount of waste being thrown out.You can also help by donating these items. The process of recycling is turning an item into a raw material that can then be made into a new item which reduces waste on the planet.  </p>

<p> The Earth is dying, and it's time for us to stand up and change the way that humans are opperating. We have taken the Earth and it's resources for granted and the affects are devestating. There is still time to right our wrongs though, so I implore you to share this website with your family, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Spread the word, it's time for a change in the way humans have been opperating. Be part of the solution, for a better Earth.
